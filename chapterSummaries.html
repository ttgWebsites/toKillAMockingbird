					<li data-theme="c">Even those from outside of town arrive including a man named Mr. Dolphus Raymond, a wealthy man who lives on a large estate with his black mistress and their children.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">When the courtroom opens for the beginning of the trial it is so crowded that Jem, Dill, and Scout must sit in the balcony with the blacks who have arrived to watch.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">The trial is presided by an older judge, Judge Taylor, who runs a very informal courtroom.</li>
				</ul>
			
				<ul data-role="listview" data-inset="true">
					<li data-theme="b">Chapter 17</li>
					<li data-theme="d">The trial begins with the questioning of Heck Tate by both sides of the trial.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Mr. Gilmer, the prosecutor begins questioning Tate about the night the alleged rape occurred.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Tate explains that on that night, November 21st, he was summoned to the Ewell household by Bob Ewell who claimed his daughter had been raped.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">When Tate arrived, he saw Mayella, the daughter, had been beaten.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Mayella also explained that Tom Robinson had raped her.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Atticus now has his turn to question Tate, and Tate admits that now doctor was called for on this night, and that the bruises were only on the right side of Mayella's face.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Eventually Ewell is summoned to testify, however before he does Scout explains to the reader that the Ewell family lives in a very poor side of town behind a garbage dump.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">The family is also large and no one is quite sure how many children there are.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">When Ewell reaches the stand he tells his account of that night; he explains that he heard his daughter screaming from the woods, and when he arrived at the house he saw Tom Robinson raping her through a window.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Ewell claims that once he noticed Tom, Tom fled.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Atticus begins his questioning and wonders why no doctor was called; Ewell explains that it was not worth the money.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Atticus then has Ewell write his name, this shows the jury that Ewell is left-handed.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Atticus finishes by saying that a left-handed person would most likely strike the right side of someone's face.</li>

				<ul data-role="listview" data-inset="true">
					<li data-theme="b">Chapter 18</li>
					<li data-theme="d">When the trial begins again it is Mayella's turn to testify on the events.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">She tells the jury that she had seen Tom walking by her house; she needed help with a task and offered him a nickel for his services.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">However, when Tom came inside, he proceeded to grab her and begin raping her.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Atticus begins his questioning and it is revealed that Mayella lives a sad life helping raise her seven siblings, putting up with an often drunk father, and having no time for any friends.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Atticus then begins to rip into her allegations by questioning why she had not put up a struggle and how come none of the other Ewell family members were aware of the events.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">He then questions the bruises on her face, as Tom would have no chance of causing them being that his left hand is maim from injuring it as a child.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Atticus demands she give the act up as it is quite obvious she is lying, however she refuses, and begins to cry causing the court to come to recess.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">In the meantime, Mr. Underwood notices Scout, Jem, and Dill in the balcony, however he chooses not to inform Atticus.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">When the trial resumes, Tom is called to the stand.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<ul data-role="listview" data-inset="true">
					<li data-theme="b">Chapter 19</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Tom explains the story differently; he had been walking by the house when Mayella summoned him in for help.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">However, unlike her story, Mayella grabbed him and tried to convince him to kiss her.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Tom refused and tried to get away, however before he could, Bob Ewell had arrived and saw what was occurring.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Bob realized his daughter was attempting to have relations with a black man, and immediately threatened her; meanwhile Tom escaped.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">During the testimony the court is interrupted by Tom's employer, Link Deas, who yells that Tom is a respectable man.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Deas is however kicked out of the courtroom.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">It is then the prosecutions turn to question Tom, and the lawyer is able to get Tom to admit that he is strong enough to overpower Mayella.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">He then questions why he was always willing to help Mayella, and Tom explains it was because he felt sorry for her.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">This makes everyone in the courtroom on edge, as it makes no sense why a black man would feel sorry for any white women.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">The lawyer finishes by accusing Tom of being a liar, causing Dill to become visibly upset in the balcony.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">The children leave the courtroom, as they cannot stand the way Mr. Gilmer is treating Tom.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">While outside the children run in to Dolphus Raymond, the man who lives on the outskirts of town with a black woman, and their children.</li>

					<li data-theme="d">Mr. Raymond is drinking from a paper bag, however he explains to Dill that it is only coke as opposed to alcohol.</li>
