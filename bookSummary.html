					<li data-theme="d">To Kill a Mockingbird is perhaps one of the most often taught pieces of literature 
					in the American classroom. The novel is set during a time period in America (post slavery) where blacks 
					are treated with disrespect and have very limited rights. The protagonist and narrator is a young girl, 
					Scout Finch, who lives in a rural Alabama town with her father (Atticus), brother (Jem), and a black cook (Calpurnia). 
					Scout is very mature for her young age, however she still has much growing up to do when the novel begins. 
					This is greatly helped by an event that occurs in Maycomb. Her father is assigned to defend a black man accused of rape.
					Though it is quite clear that the man, Tom Robinson, is innocent, during this setting a black man's word holds 
					very little weight. Tom is convicted and sentenced to death, an event quite shocking for a young child. 
					Scout cannot see how someone could hold such prejudice, let alone a whole town of people. These events 
					and the events following cause Scout to mature into a strong-willed young woman.</li>
